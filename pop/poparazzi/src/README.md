This directory contains the development area for the poparazzi tool.

This tool is used to make it easy to work with POP-style Perl projects.

This latest version has the setup functionality.

It will allow you to make a file set, the .pl, .pm and .prep.sh files for your project

It will also allow you to add CPAN and home-grown module use statements to the .pm file in the correct locations

It will also allow you to add template subroutines to a .pm file with proper POD headings and inserted in alphabetical order into the pm file.

Hopefully this tool will evolve to include refactoring usecases as well.

But in its current state it should get you started on a POP style project.

Try it out, you might like it.
